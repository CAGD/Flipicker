#Flipicker

__A jQuery flip-clock time-picker plugin__

Takes a form input containing a time (in milliseconds since 12.00am) and converts it into a flip-clock time-picker. Clicking on the lower half of the minutes advances it by 5 minutes, the upper half decreases the time by 5 minutes. Clicking on the lower half of the hours advances the time by one hour, the upper half decreases it by one hour.
